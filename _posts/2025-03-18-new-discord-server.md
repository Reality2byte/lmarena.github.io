Over the past two years, with the incredible support of our community, LMArena has grown into a vibrant ecosystem and platform with just a team of contributors, advisors and partnerships. Today, we’re excited to begin sharing community updates in our blog as we continue to make progress towards long-term growth.

## A Platform for the Future

First, let’s take a trip down memory lane [when we graduated from LMSys](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1837233036624286126) in September 2024 to establish LMArena as an independent platform. With the continued strong partnership with LMSys, we broadened our scope to evaluate not just chatbots but also frontier AI models in areas like [WebDev Arena](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1899181467252711593), complex tasks, and red-teaming. This expansion allowed us to deepen our insights and provide even more value to the AI community.

LMSys has always been more than just a single initiative—it has served as a research collective behind projects like Vicuna, Chatbot Arena, SGLang, S-LoRA, RouteLLM, and more. As LMArena takes on a life of its own, LMSys will continue to foster new projects and drive open research. If you’re interested in contributing to the future of AI, there’s never been a better time to get involved.

## Our New Discord Server

With this exciting evolution, we recently also launched a dedicated Discord community server earlier this month! Join us at: [discord.gg/LMArena](discord.gg/LMArena)! This will be the new hub for all things LMArena—where we’ll share insights on ongoing projects, leaderboard updates, and even host community-driven events and surprises.

In fact, we recently held our very first community event in the new Discord server, where over 20 members joined us for a walkthrough of the new desktop UI design in alpha. We also dove into community feedback on the voting UI—as your voices are shaping the future of the platform, and we can’t wait to continue these conversations with you. It was an exciting opportunity to connect directly with the community, discuss upcoming improvements, and get live input on the changes. We’re looking forward to hosting many more events like this so [give us your feedback on what you’d like to see](https://forms.gle/mgSodQEa28r8J5cz7).

## Our Vision for the Community

At its core, LMArena is about building together—whether you’re an AI Enthusiast, developer, or AI company, we want to create something that benefits everyone. Free access to models is incredibly valuable for those exploring AI, and the feedback collected through the Arena has proven to be an essential resource in improving AI systems. As part of our commitment to transparency, we’re dedicated to responsibly releasing portions of this data while maintaining the integrity of evaluations. This is to support our vision of advancing open AI evaluation and accessibility.

## Our Mission and Next Chapter

Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to expand our tools, provide deeper insights, and explore new ways to engage with AI models. Our mission is to make AI reliable and to provide sustainable services for everyone. This guiding principle shapes our efforts as we continue to push the boundaries of AI research and accessibility.

This is just the beginning, and we couldn’t have done it without you—our amazing community. Thank you for being part of this journey. We can’t wait to see what we’ll build together next. Arena is currently built and run with a team of contributors and advisors, but we're actively looking to grow and explore paths that help us deliver on this big mission very soon.

Come join us in our new Discord ([discord.gg/LMArena](discord.gg/LMArena)), and let’s shape the future of AI, together!
